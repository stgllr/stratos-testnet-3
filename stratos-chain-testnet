How to connect Stratos Chain Testnet
Prepare environment to run node
0. Create user account(optional)
to create separated and more secure environment it is recommended to create separate user account to run node

sudo adduser stratos --home /home/stratos
once user is created login to system using stratos account and proceed with installation steps in context of that user

Download release binary
1. get stchaind & stchaincli binary file
PLEASE NOTE: these binary are built using linux amd64, so if you are preparing run a node on different kernel, please follow step 1.1 to build binary for your machine

wget https://github.com/stratosnet/stratos-chain/releases/download/v0.5.0/stchaincli
wget https://github.com/stratosnet/stratos-chain/releases/download/v0.5.0/stchaind
then check the granularity

md5sum stchain*

## expect output 
## aded93fa2f1f4816375dcb425ec4ce42 stchaincli
## 2d79092bd2096baa82879edc64c17294 stchaind
add execute permission for the binary downloaded

chmod +x stchaincli
chmod +x stchaind
1.1 compile the binary with source code
Make sure you have Go 1.15+ installed (link).

git clone https://github.com/stratosnet/stratos-chain.git
cd stratos-chain
git checkout v0.5.0
make build
The binary can be found in ./build folder

you can also install the binary to $GOPATH/bin by

make install
2. get the genesis and config file
initialize the node

./stchaind init --home ./  "<node name you prefer>"

# ignore the output since you need to download the genesis file 
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stratosnet/stratos-chain-testnet/main/genesis.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stratosnet/stratos-chain-testnet/main/config.toml
change your node moniker in config.toml (optional if you don't want to become validator)

# A custom human readable name for this node
moniker = "<node name you prefer>"
move the config.toml and genesis.json file to config folder

mv config.toml config/
mv genesis.json config/
3. run the node
./stchaind start --home ./ 
after this, the node will try to catch up with the blockchain to the latest block

you can run the node in background

./stchaind start --home ./ 2>&1 >> chain.log &
for more info about get test token from faucet and send tx.
create an account
./stchaincli keys add --hd-path "m/44'/606'/0'/0/0" --keyring-backend test --home ./ wallet1
Faucet
faucet will be available at https://faucet-test.thestratos.org/ get some test token

curl -X POST https://faucet-test.thestratos.org/faucet/<your address>
1 stos = 1000000000 ustos

the faucet is default to send 100 stos to the provided address

check balance (you need to wait for your node catching up with the network)

./stchaincli query account <your address> --home ./
to check node status

./stchaincli status --home ./
send your first tx
./stchaincli tx send <from address> <to address> <amount> --home ./ --keyring-backend test --chain-id test-chain-1 

# then input y for the pop up to confirm send
4. run node as a service
NOTE: All below steps require root privileges

create file /lib/systemd/system/stratos.service with following content:

[Unit]
Description=Stratos Chain Node
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=stratos
Group=stratos
ExecStart=/home/stratos/stchaind start --home=/home/stratos/.stchaind
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=8192

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
once service file is created you need to enable and start service:

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable stratos.service
systemctl start stratos.service
to check if service is runnign as expected:

systemctl status stratos.service
to check the node log

journalctl -u stratos.service -f 
# exit with ctrl+c
